# Thesis - Automated Data Preprocessing Techniques in Multiple Datasets

The thesis focuses on finding the best combinations of machine learning algorithms with a scaler for the classification and regression experiments. They were used and pre-processed ten datasets for classification and ten for regression with different attributes and records with several techniques (imputing the missing values, encoding categorical values to numerical and feature scaling).
